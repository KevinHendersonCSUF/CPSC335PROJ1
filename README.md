# CPSC-335 Project 1 README.md for Algorithm 1 and 2| Kevin Henderson, Bryan Tran, Kenny Ly, Nathan Preheim

Algorithm 1:
Enter The amount of cities that will be visited, then give the corresponding distances from each city.

Example: If there are 5 cities, you will enter the distances from city 0 - > city 1 and so on until city 4 -> city 0 (because last distance is equal to the distance from the last city to the first city)

Then you will be prompted to enter the amount of fuel available at each city

Then finally, enter the mpg for the car and the program will execute the algorithm to find the preferred starting city

Algorithm 2:
Enter an integer value for row length that is less than 60 and even. 

Example: entering 4 will produce a row containing 4 individuals

Enter the integer value of each individual at the given index.

Program will execute the algorithm and print the minimum amount of swaps needed and the row after all the swap operations are performed.
