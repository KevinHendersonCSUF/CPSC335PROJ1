Algorithm 1:

Algorithm 2:
Enter an integer value for row length that is less than 60 and even. 
example: entering 4 will produce a row containing 4 individuals

Enter the integer value of each individual at the given index

Program will execute the algorithm and print the minimum amount of swaps needed and the row after all the swap operations are performed
